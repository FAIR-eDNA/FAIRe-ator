**Versioning note:**  
- This script is versioned independently from the [FAIRe metadata checklist](https://github.com/FAIR-eDNA/FAIRe_checklist), which uses semantic versions like `v1.0`, `v1.0.2`.
- The most up-to-date version of the script will always be named `FAIReator.R`. Archived versions include the version number in the filename (e.g., `FAIReator_v1.0.0.R`) and are stored in the `previous_versions` folder for reference.
- Refer to this changelog for the scriptâ€™s own version history.
